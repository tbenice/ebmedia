This is the Read Me file for Scout.

Scout is a Site Navigation aid. It can be used to assist new visitors to your site. It can also by used to help train content managers, guiding them through steps for creation and administration of site content.

Scout is a module/features package of the Zurb Joyride jQuery library for Drupal 7. The Zurb Joyride jQuery library is currently being implemented in Drupal 8 core as "Tours."

Scout brings Joyride functionality along with the Drupal 8 ease of tour creation to Drupal 7. Scout adds a custom Context reaction plug-in to Drupal 7, but works differently than the plugin provided by the Joyride module. Rather than providing a long text field for entering HTML, Scout's context reaction allows you to select a previously assembled Scout Trail (tour) from a simple pull-down list.

This module provides integration of the Zurb Joyride Jquery library and adds a custom Context reaction plug-in for placing Scout Trails on your Drupal web pages.

In order to create Scout Tips and Trails, install the Scout & Scout Trails modules (scout_trails is included in Scout's "modules" sub-directory).

It has its own README.txt to help you get started.
